                    Welcome to CleanSlate, where we make household chores fun and fair! Track your tasks, see their value as if they were paid, and compare with your partner. Discover a balanced home life with our easy-to-use app, designed for teamwork and appreciation. Join us in celebrating and equalizing the unseen efforts of home life!

                    Here&apos;s how it works: Simply log the time you spend on different chores, and voil√†! The app calculates what that effort would be worth if it were a paid job.
                    You&apos;ll be surprised at how much you&apos;re actually contributing to your household!
                </p>

                    It&apos;s not just about numbers though; it&apos;s about appreciation. You get to see your own stats and costs, and even compare them with your partners. Think of it as a fun and eye-opening way to acknowledge each others contributions at home.

                <p className="frontpage-about-text">
                    It&apos;s all about making sure everyone feels valued and keeping things fair and square at home.
                    Our goal? To nudge couples towards a happy, equitable balance in their domestic life. CleanSlate isn&apos;t just an app; it&apos;s your partner in fostering great conversations and a harmonious home.</p>
