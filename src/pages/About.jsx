        Welcome to CleanSweep - the friendly app that brings a new perspective to household chores!

The app calculates what that effort would be worth if it were a paid job.

        It’s not just about numbers though; it’s about appreciation. You get to see your own stats and costs, and even compare them with your partner’s. Think of it as a fun and eye-opening way to acknowledge each others contributions at home.

        And hey, if things are a bit lopsided in the chore department, CleanSweep has a neat solution. You can easily balance things out by sending a little thank-you via Swish to your partner.
